# Kubernetes basics

> **Kubernetes** (K8s) is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications [(kubernetes.io)](https://kubernetes.io/)

## Introduction

Kubernetes is an orchestration system to deploy and manage containers in order to serve decoupled and transcient services.

### History

Kubernetes, Greek word for Helmsman (or pilot of the ship), has been created by Google from their experience on internal Google products called [**Borg**](https://research.google/pubs/pub43438/), which has been used during 15 years, and [**Omega**](https://research.google/pubs/pub41684/) (know more by listening to [GCP Podcast episode](https://www.gcppodcast.com/post/episode-46-borg-and-k8s-with-john-wilkes/)).

Kubernetes is written in Go language, with the Apache license.

Google donated Kubernetes to the [Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF)](https://www.cncf.io/) within The Linux Foundation in July 2015, when Kubernetes reached the v1.0 release.

</details>

- **Head node(s)** (only Linux, previously named master node(s)): main manager which have several agents, all head nodes constitue the **Control Plane**
  - `kube-apiserver` (frontend): handles all traffic (internal & external), authenticates/validates and forwards API calls (REST operations), persists state in `etcd` (only component to talk to the database)
    <details>
      <summary>Additional information</summary>
  
      - Starting as an alpha feature in v1.16 is the ability to separate user-initiated traffic from server-initiated traffic.
    </details>
    
  - `kube-scheduler`: determines which node will host a Pod (through an algorithm)
  - `etcd`: database/storage system (b+tree key-value store) of the cluster state, container settings, networking configurations
    <details>
      <summary>Additional information</summary>
  
      - Rather than finding and changing an entry, values are always appended to the end. Previous copies of the data are then marked for future removal by a compaction process. It is expected to receive error 409 errors if the value has been updated between while processing a request.
      - There is a master database along with possible followers. While very fast and potentially durable, there have been some hiccups with new tools, such as kubeadm, and features like whole cluster upgrades.
    </details>
    
  - [`kube-controller-manager`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/kube-controller-manager/): core control loop daemon which interacts with the `kube-apiserver` that regulates the state of the system, responsible for running resource controllers such as Deployments
  - [`cloud-controller-manager`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/running-cloud-controller/): interacts with the cloud provider (if cloud-based clusters), managing resources such as load balancers and disk volumes, allows cloud vendors to evolve independently from the core Kubernetes code
- **Worder nodes** (Linux, and Windows since 1.14 release)
  - `kubelet`: receives requests to run the containers, manages any necessary resources and watches over them on the local node, interacts with the local container engine, which is `Docker` by default, but could be `containerd` or `cri-o` (or any implementation of the Kubernetes [CRI (Container Runtime Interface)](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/sig-node/container-runtime-interface.md))
  - [`kube-proxy`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/kube-proxy/): creates and manages networking rules to expose the container on the network
    - 3 proxy-modes: 'userspace' (older) or 'iptables' (faster) or 'ipvs' (or 'kernelspace' for Windows)

### API

[API Overview](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/kubernetes-api/) > [API Reference](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubernetes-api/)

### Controllers

[Kubernetes Documentation/Concepts/Cluster Architecture/Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/)

**Controllers** are a series of watch-loops which makes possible the orchestration through Kubernetes. Each **Controller** interrogates the `kube-apiserver` for a particular object state, modifying the object until the declared state matches the current state. These controllers are compiled into the `kube-controller-manager`.

Samples: [kubernetes/sample-controller](https://github.com/kubernetes/sample-controller)

#### Built-in controllers

- [CronJobs](./objects/cronjob.md)
- [DaemonSet](./objects/daemonset.md)
- [Deployments](./objects/deployment.md)
- [Jobs](./objects/job.md)
- [ReplicaSets](./objects/replicaset.md)
- [StatefulSet](./objects/statefulset.md)

### Extensions

- [Operators](./extensions/operator.md)

### Configuration

- [ConfigMaps](./objects/configmap.md)
- [Secrets](./objects/secret.md)

#### Container runtime

Reference: [Documentation / Getting started / Production environment / Container runtimes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/production-environment/container-runtimes/)

Kubernetes uses a container runtime to run containers in Pods. There are mainly 3:

- [Docker engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/) is the default container runtime for Kubernetes
- [CRI-O](https://cri-o.io/) ([cri-o/cri-o](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o))
  - [Awesome CRI-O](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/blob/master/awesome.md)
- [containerd](https://containerd.io/) ([containerd/containerd](https://github.com/containerd/containerd))

_Note_: [rktlet](https://github.com/kubernetes-retired/rktlet) and [rkt](https://github.com/rkt/rkt) projects have been ended

</details>

#### Containerized image

The [Open Container Initiative (OCI)](https://opencontainers.org/) is an open governance structure for the express purpose of creating open industry standards around container formats and runtimes. Source repositories are managed inside [opencontainers](https://github.com/opencontainers) GitHub organization.

There are currently two specifications:

- [Runtime Specification (runtime-spec)](https://github.com/opencontainers/runtime-spec)
- [Image Specification (image-spec)](https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec)

Docker donated [runC](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc) to OCI.

### Probes

Probe type | Reason
---------- | ------
**Readiness** | Make sure the application is ready to accept traffic
**Liveness** | Make sure the application is running ok

### Metadata

#### Labels

To make management easier, we can use **Labels**, arbitrary strings which become part of the object metadata.

**Label selectors** are a very powerful way to get the Kubernetes objects we want to interact with.

```bash
kubectl get pod -n <namespace> --selector app=<application-name>
```

### Storage

- [Persistent Volumes](./docs/objects/persistentvolume.md)
- [Persistent Volume Claims](./docs/objects/persistentvolumeclaim.md)

## Security

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

Introduced in 1.6 as an option when setting up clusters, should be turned on.

_Tip_: execute `kubectl describe pod -n kube-system -l component=kube-apiserver` and look at `--authorization-mode` to see if it's enabled

Kubernetes Objects:

- ClusterRole
- RoleBinding
