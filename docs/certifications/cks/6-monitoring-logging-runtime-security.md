> Detect threats within physical infrastructure, apps, networks, data, users and workloads

### Attack phases

> Detect all phases of attack regardless where it occurs and how it spreads

### Analysis

> Perform deep analytical investigation and identification of bad actors within environment

### Immutability

> Ensure immutability of containers at runtime

### Audit logs

> Use Audit Logs to monitor access
