## In case the Kubernetes applications do not need to use IAM, block access to IAM credentials

Context: Kubernetes containers running on AWS may be able to access IAM credentials. For EC2, IP address is 169.254.169.254.

Solution: create a network policy

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: cloud-metadata-deny
  namespace: default
spec:
  podSelector: {}
  policyTypes:
    - Egress
  egress:
    - to:
      - ipBlock:
          cidr: 0.0.0.0/0
          except:
            - 169.254.169.254/32
```
