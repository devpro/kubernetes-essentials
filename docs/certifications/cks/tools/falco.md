# Falco

> **Falco** is a cloud-native security tool designed for Linux systems. It employs custom rules on kernel events, which are enriched with container and Kubernetes metadata, to provide real-time alerts.  
>
> **Falco** helps you gain visibility into abnormal behavior, potential security threats, and compliance violations, contributing to comprehensive runtime security.

## Default configuration

‚ú® [Default and Local Rules Files](https://falco.org/docs/rules/default-custom/), [Default Rules](https://falco.org/docs/reference/rules/default-rules/)

`/etc/falco/falco.yaml` is the default configuration file.

It makes Falco load rules from the `/etc/falco/falco_rules.yaml` file followed by any custom rules located in the `/etc/falco/rules.d` directory. This configuration is governed by the `rules_file` key:

```yaml
rules_file:
  - /etc/falco/falco_rules.yaml
  - /etc/falco/falco_rules.local.yaml
  - /etc/falco/rules.d
```
