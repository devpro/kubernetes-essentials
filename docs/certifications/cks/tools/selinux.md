# Security Enhanced Linux (SELinux)

> SELinux is a flexible Mandatory Access Control (MAC) system built into the Linux Kernel.
> SELinux provides administrators with a comprehensive access control mechanism that enables greater access granularity over the existing Linux Discretionary Access Controls (DAC) and is present in many major Linux distributions.
> This repository contains the sources for the SELinux utilities and system libraries which allow for the configuration and management of an SELinux-based system.
