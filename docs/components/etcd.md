# etcd

> etcd is a strongly consistent, distributed key-value store that provides a reliable way to store data that needs to be accessed by a distributed system or cluster of machines. It gracefully handles leader elections during network partitions and can tolerate machine failure, even in the leader node.

## Procedures

### Backup & restore

```bash
# create a backup (look at the options, for example to etcd pod if it's running as a pod, or at the running process with ps command)
ETCDCTL_API=3 etcdctl --endpoints https://127.0.0.1:2379 --cacert="/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/ca.crt" --cert="/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/server.crt" --key="/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/server.key" snapshot save /opt/snapshot-pre-boot.db

# restore the backup in a folder
ETCDCTL_API=3 etcdctl snapshot restore /opt/snapshot-pre-boot.db --data-dir="/var/lib/etcd-after-restore"

# update static pod hostpath value in volumes section (if relevant) to use the new data directory
vi /etc/kubernetes/manifests/etcd.yaml

# wait for everything to come up...
```
