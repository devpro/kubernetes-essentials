[Kubernetes 1.19: CNCF Webinar](https://www.cncf.io/webinars/kubernetes-1-19/)

1. Support for Kubernetes will be increased from 9 months (or 3 releases) to one year (stable)

2. There is a defined process on how API transition from Beta to GA (stable)

3. The API server will include a warning header when you use deprecated APIs (beta)

4. ".status.conditions" is standardised across objects (stable)

5. Standardise on "http://node-role.kubernetes.io" label (beta)

6. Removed the beta APIs from the conformance tests (beta)

7. Support CRI-ContainerD on Windows (beta)

8. The process to obtain the kubelet certificate and rotate it as its expiration date approaches is now stable

9. NodeRestriction admission plugin prevents Kubelets from self-setting labels within core namespaces (stable)

10. The Certificates API includes a Registration Authority to provision certificates for non-core uses (stable)

11. New kubeadm component config scheme aimed at customisable default for kubelets and core components (alpha)

12. You can include patched to your Kubeadm config (alpha)

13. A standard structure for Kubernetes log messages (alpha)

14. Redesign Event API (stable)

15. Ingress graduates to V1 (stable)

16. The new EndpointSlice API will split endpoints into several Endpoint Slice resources (beta)

17. The EndpointSlice API added a new AppProtocol field to allow application protocols to be specified for each port (beta)

18. SCTP is now supported as an additional protocol alongside TCP and UDP in Pod, Service, Endpoint, and NetworkPolicy (beta)

19. It is possible to set a pod’s hostname to its Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) (alpha)

20. The Kubelet isn't expected to gather metrics anymore. This is delegated to the PodResources API (alpha)

21. The node topology manager is a kubelet component that centralizes the coordination of hardware resource assignments (beta)

22. Seccomp provides sandboxing, it reduces the actions that a process can perform which reduces a system potential attack surface (stable)

23. You can build Kubelet without Docker (stable)

24. You can define a global defaultConstraints that will be applied at cluster level to all of the pods that don’t define their own topologySpreadConstraints (alpha)

25. ComponentConfig is an ongoing effort to make component configuration more dynamic (beta)

26. With topologySpreadConstraints, you can define rules to distribute your pods evenly across your multi-zone cluster, so high availability will work correctly and the resource utilization will be efficient (beta)

27. With "PreemptionPolicy: Never" Pods can be placed in the scheduling queue ahead of lower-priority pods, but they cannot preempt other pods (beta)

28. You can run the scheduler with multiple Scheduling Profiles (beta)

29. New API for generic ephemeral inline volumes (alpha)

30. Storage Capacity Tracking prevents pods to be scheduled on nodes connected to CSI volumes without enough free space available (alpha)

31. CSI drivers can opt-in to volume ownership change (alpha)

32. Immutable Secrets and ConfigMaps (beta)

33. Azure disk in-tree driver is moved to CSI (beta)

34. vSphere disk in-tree driver is moved to CSI (beta)
